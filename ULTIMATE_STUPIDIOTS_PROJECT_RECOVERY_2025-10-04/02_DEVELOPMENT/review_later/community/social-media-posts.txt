"üé≠ Welcome to the IDIOT Community!

Here's the thing - we're all idiots sometimes. We buy high, sell low, FOMO into pumps, and make emotional trades. 

But here's what makes us different: We ADMIT it. We EMBRACE it. We LAUGH at it.

This is a safe space to:
- Share your dumbest moves
- Learn from others' mistakes  
- Make questionable decisions together
- Have fun while losing money

Rules:
- Be respectful
- Keep it funny
- No financial advice (obviously)
- Embrace the chaos

Welcome to the IDIOT family! üöÄ"

"IDIOT Token: Where We Embrace Our Mistakes

Hey r/CryptoCurrency,

We're launching IDIOT token on Base, and here's the thing - we're not pretending to be geniuses. We're idiots, and we know it.

Our tagline: 'ROMO over FOMO' (Rational Over Meme Over FOMO)

We're building a community where people can:
- Share their dumbest trading moves
- Learn from each other's mistakes
- Make questionable decisions together
- Have fun while doing it

No promises of mooning. No 'this time it's different.' Just honest idiocy and community.

What do you think? Ready to embrace your inner idiot?
