# 🚀 Digital Ocean Deployment Fix Guide

## 🎯 **PROBLEM IDENTIFIED**
Your stupidiots.com site is serving an older version because you uploaded the wrong directory to Digital Ocean.

## ❌ **What You Uploaded (WRONG):**
- `stupidiots-website-clean/` directory
- **Missing:** Main `index.html` file (your homepage)
- **Result:** Digital Ocean serves cached/old version

## ✅ **What You Need to Upload (CORRECT):**
- Root directory contents with `index.html` (59KB, updated Oct 11 19:28)
- All assets, airdrop files, and directories

## 🔧 **IMMEDIATE FIX STEPS:**

### Step 1: Upload Correct Files
1. **Download:** `stupidiots-correct-files.tar.gz` (15MB) - I just created this for you
2. **Upload to Digital Ocean:** Extract this file to your `public_html/` directory
3. **Ensure:** `index.html` is in the root of `public_html/`

### Step 2: Verify File Structure on Digital Ocean
Your `public_html/` directory should contain:
```
public_html/
├── index.html                    ← MAIN HOMEPAGE (MUST BE PRESENT)
├── assets/
│   └── img/
│       ├── ChatGPT Image Sep 28, 2025, 04_50_50 PM.png
│       ├── logo.png
│       ├── coin-1.png
│       └── [other images]
├── airdrop/
│   ├── index.html
│   ├── idiocracy
│   └── idiocracy-1.json
├── careers/
├── jobs/
├── legal/
└── [other directories]
```

### Step 3: Clear Cache
1. **Clear Digital Ocean cache** (if using CDN)
2. **Hard refresh** your browser (Ctrl+F5)
3. **Test:** Visit stupidiots.com

## 🎯 **CRITICAL FILES TO VERIFY:**

### ✅ Must Have:
- `index.html` in root of public_html/
- `assets/img/ChatGPT Image Sep 28, 2025, 04_50_50 PM.png`
- `assets/img/logo.png`
- `airdrop/idiocracy` file
- `airdrop/idiocracy-1.json` file

### 🔍 **Quick Test:**
Visit these URLs to verify:
- `https://stupidiots.com/` (should show your main page)
- `https://stupidiots.com/airdrop/` (should show airdrop page)
- `https://stupidiots.com/assets/img/logo.png` (should show logo)

## 📋 **DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST:**

- [ ] Upload `stupidiots-correct-files.tar.gz` to Digital Ocean
- [ ] Extract to `public_html/` directory
- [ ] Verify `index.html` exists in root of `public_html/`
- [ ] Verify hero background image exists: `ChatGPT Image Sep 28, 2025, 04_50_50 PM.png`
- [ ] Clear any CDN/cache
- [ ] Test main page loads correctly
- [ ] Test airdrop links work
- [ ] Verify all images load

## 🚨 **COMMON ISSUES:**

1. **Still showing old version?**
   - Clear browser cache (Ctrl+F5)
   - Check if CDN needs cache clearing
   - Verify correct files uploaded

2. **Images not loading?**
   - Check file paths in `public_html/assets/img/`
   - Verify image filenames match exactly

3. **Airdrop links broken?**
   - Verify `airdrop/` directory uploaded
   - Check `idiocracy` and `idiocracy-1.json` files exist
