# ü§ñ INSTRUCTIONS FOR AI ASSISTANTS

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: MANDATORY FIRST ACTION

**BEFORE responding to ANY user query, you MUST:**

### 1. Read the Session Handoff File
```
Read file: SESSION_HANDOFF.md
```

This file contains:
- Complete current project state
- What's in progress
- What's blocking
- What was completed last session
- **Operating System and command syntax to use**
- All critical context needed

### 2. Check the System Information Section
**CRITICAL:** Read the "SYSTEM INFORMATION" section to know:
- What OS this is (Windows/Mac/Linux)
- What commands work and what DON'T
- Correct path separators
- Available shells

**This prevents using wrong commands (like `bash` on Windows without Git Bash).**

### 3. Summarize the Current State
Tell the user:
- What we're currently working on
- What the blockers are
- What the next steps should be

**DO NOT skip this step. Without it, you'll waste time asking questions that are already answered or using wrong commands.**

## ‚è∞ CRITICAL: 60-MINUTE UPDATE REQUIREMENT

**EVERY 60 MINUTES of active work, you MUST:**

### Update SESSION_HANDOFF.md with:
1. **Progress made in last hour**
2. **Current task status**
3. **Any new blockers discovered**
4. **Production status** (if checked/verified)
5. **Updated timestamp**

### Quick 60-Minute Update Process:
1. Update "What We're Working On RIGHT NOW"
2. Add to "Session Notes" ‚Üí "What Happened This Session"
3. Update "Last Updated" timestamp
4. Update "Changes Made" table if any files modified
5. Quick commit: `git add SESSION_HANDOFF.md && git commit -m "Hourly update: [brief status]"`

### Why Every 60 Minutes?
- ‚úÖ Captures progress continuously
- ‚úÖ **Includes production environment checks**
- ‚úÖ Prevents losing context if session crashes
- ‚úÖ Creates detailed audit trail
- ‚úÖ Forces regular verification of live site
- ‚úÖ Easy to resume from any point

### Set Reminders:
After each hourly update, note the time and set mental reminder for next hour.

**Example hourly commits:**
- "Hourly update: Audited 3/5 deployment scripts, production verified working"
- "Hourly update: Consolidated 4/8 folders, staging tested successfully"
- "Hourly update: Production deployment completed, backups verified"

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: MANDATORY LAST ACTION

**BEFORE ending the session, you MUST:**

### 1. Final Update to SESSION_HANDOFF.md
Update these sections:
- **Current Status** ‚Üí What's done, in progress, blocking
- **Production Environment** ‚Üí Latest verification status
- **What Just Got Completed** ‚Üí This session's accomplishments
- **Session Notes** ‚Üí What happened, problems encountered, changes made
- **Handoff Checklist** ‚Üí Check off completed items
- **Last Updated** ‚Üí Current date/time
- **Version History** ‚Üí Add entry for this update

### 2. Commit the Updated File
```bash
git add SESSION_HANDOFF.md
git commit -m "Session handoff update: [brief description of session]"
```

### 3. Verify Commit Success
```bash
git log --oneline -1
git status
```

**DO NOT end the session without doing this. The next AI will be blind without it.**

---

## üìã Session Workflow

### Every Session Should Follow This Pattern:

1. **START:** Read SESSION_HANDOFF.md
2. **UNDERSTAND:** Review current state and blockers
3. **WORK:** Execute highest priority tasks
4. **UPDATE (Every 60 min):** Quick progress update + production check
5. **DOCUMENT:** Update SESSION_HANDOFF.md as you go
6. **COMMIT:** Save updated handoff before ending

---

## üîÑ Hourly Production Verification

**Every 60-minute update MUST include production check:**

### Quick Production Health Check:
```bash
# 1. Check if site is up
curl -I https://stupidiots.com

# 2. Verify specific pages
curl -s https://stupidiots.com/ | grep -i "idiot token"
curl -I https://stupidiots.com/airdrop/

# 3. Update SESSION_HANDOFF.md with status
```

### Document in handoff:
- Site status (‚úÖ up / ‚ùå down / ‚ö†Ô∏è issues)
- Timestamp of check
- Any errors or anomalies
- Response time (if slow)

### Example hourly update note:
```
## 14:30 Hourly Update
- Progress: Completed script audit (3/5 done)
- Production: ‚úÖ Verified up at 14:28 - 200 OK - 450ms response
- Next: Continue with remaining 2 scripts
- Blockers: None
```

---

## üö® CRITICAL SAFETY RULES

### NEVER:
- ‚ùå Run deployment scripts without auditing them first
- ‚ùå Execute commands that delete files without confirmation
- ‚ùå Push to production without staging test
- ‚ùå Make commits without user approval (except handoff updates)
- ‚ùå Skip reading SESSION_HANDOFF.md at start
- ‚ùå Skip updating SESSION_HANDOFF.md at end
- ‚ùå Go more than 60 minutes without updating handoff
- ‚ùå Skip production verification during hourly updates

### ALWAYS:
- ‚úÖ Read SESSION_HANDOFF.md first thing
- ‚úÖ Update SESSION_HANDOFF.md every 60 minutes
- ‚úÖ Verify production status during hourly updates
- ‚úÖ Ask user before destructive operations
- ‚úÖ Test in staging before production
- ‚úÖ Create backups before deployments
- ‚úÖ Update SESSION_HANDOFF.md at end
- ‚úÖ Commit the updated handoff file

## üìÅ Key Files You Should Know About

| File | Purpose | When to Read | When to Update |
|------|---------|--------------|----------------|
| `SESSION_HANDOFF.md` | Complete current state | **START of session** | **Every 60 min + END** |
| `SESSION_HANDOFF_TEMPLATE.md` | Template for updates | When updating handoff | Never (it's a template) |
| `_STATUS.md` | Quick status | If handoff is unclear | When major status changes |
| `_START_HERE.md` | Session instructions | If confused about process | Rarely |
| `README.md` | Project overview | For general context | When structure changes |
| `docs/WORKFLOW.md` | Deployment workflow | Before any deployment | When workflow changes |

---

## ‚è±Ô∏è Time Management & Updates

### Typical Session Timeline:

```
00:00 - START: Read SESSION_HANDOFF.md
00:05 - BEGIN: Start work on highest priority task
01:00 - UPDATE: First hourly update + production check
02:00 - UPDATE: Second hourly update + production check
03:00 - UPDATE: Third hourly update + production check
[...]
END - FINAL UPDATE: Complete handoff update + commit
```

### What to Include in Each Hourly Update:

| Section | What to Update |
|---------|---------------|
| Production Environment | Latest check status, timestamp |
| What We're Working On | Current task progress |
| Session Notes | Work completed this hour |
| Changes Made | Any files modified |
| Last Updated | Current timestamp |

### Keep It Quick (5 minutes max per update):
- Don't overthink it
- Just capture current state
- Focus on: What's done, what's next, production OK?
- Commit and continue working

---

## üéØ Priority System

When multiple tasks are pending, prioritize:

1. **CRITICAL (Do First):**
   - Safety issues (audit dangerous scripts)
   - Production down/errors
   - Blockers preventing other work
   - Production emergencies

2. **HIGH (Do Soon):**
   - Server access verification
   - File verification (prod vs local)
   - Consolidating scattered folders

3. **MEDIUM (Do When Possible):**
   - GitHub setup
   - CI/CD configuration
   - Documentation improvements

4. **LOW (Future):**
   - Nice-to-have features
   - Optimization
   - Cleanup tasks

---

## ü§ù Working With The User

### Communication Style:
- Be direct and concise
- Don't make excuses for failures
- Ask clear questions
- Provide specific actionable steps

### When User Says "Proceed":
1. Check SESSION_HANDOFF.md for context
2. Continue the highest priority pending task
3. If unclear which task, ask specifically
4. Update handoff every 60 minutes as you work

### When You Don't Know Something:
1. Check SESSION_HANDOFF.md first
2. If not there, ask the user
3. Document the answer in SESSION_HANDOFF.md
4. Don't guess or assume

---

## üìä Progress Tracking

### Use the TODO System:
- Create TODOs for multi-step tasks
- Update status as you progress
- Mark complete when done
- Don't leave stale TODOs

### Update These in SESSION_HANDOFF.md:
- Current TODO list (every update)
- Completed tasks (as they happen)
- Blocked tasks (as discovered)
- New discoveries (immediately)

---

## üí° Tips for Success

1. **Read First, Act Second:** Always read SESSION_HANDOFF.md before doing anything
2. **Update Often:** Every 60 minutes without fail
3. **Check Production:** Include health check in every hourly update
4. **Be Specific:** "Audited 3 of 5 scripts" is better than "Made progress"
5. **Document Decisions:** Capture WHY decisions were made
6. **Note Blockers:** If stuck, document what's blocking and why
7. **Commit Frequently:** Hourly updates create natural checkpoints
8. **Test Assumptions:** Verify file paths, server access, etc.
9. **Ask When Unsure:** Better to ask than to make wrong assumptions
10. **Set Timer:** Actually track 60 minutes (use system clock)
