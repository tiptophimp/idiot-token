- Can adjust pool parameters as needed
- Can rebalance based on market conditions
- Community can verify all movements

### **No Team Allocation:**
- No separate team vesting
- Team compensated through treasury multisig
- Aligned with project success
- No hidden pre-allocated tokens

## 💬 **Philosophy**

**IDIOT Token is:**
- Honest about what we have
- Transparent about what we're doing
- Flexible enough to adapt
- Community-focused above all

**IDIOT Token is NOT:**
- A complex DeFi protocol
- Pretending to be more than we are
- Promising guaranteed returns
- A "serious" investment token

We're smart about dumb fun. That means being honest, transparent, and building something the community actually wants.
