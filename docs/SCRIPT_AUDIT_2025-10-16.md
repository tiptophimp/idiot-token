# 🔍 Deployment Scripts Security Audit

**Date:** 2025-10-16  
**Auditor:** Novalex AI  
**Severity:** CRITICAL issues found  

---

## ⚠️ CRITICAL FINDINGS

### 1. ❌ **deploy-to-staging.sh** - Line 84
```bash
sudo rm -rf "$REMOTE_DIR"/*
```
**Risk:** CRITICAL  
**Issue:** Deletes all files in staging directory without confirmation  
**If `$REMOTE_DIR` is wrong:** Could delete production or system files  
**Safety:** Has variable but no validation  

### 2. ❌ **rollback-production.sh** - Line 109
```bash
sudo rm -rf "$REMOTE_DIR"/*
```
**Risk:** CRITICAL  
**Issue:** Deletes all production files during rollback  
**If `$REMOTE_DIR` is wrong:** Could delete entire production site  
**Safety:** User must confirm, but still dangerous  

---

## ⚠️ MEDIUM FINDINGS

### 3. ⚠️ **backup-rotation.sh** - Line 62
```bash
rm -f "$OLD_BACKUP"
```
**Risk:** MEDIUM  
**Issue:** Deletes old backups (expected behavior)  
**Safety:** Only deletes backup files in controlled loop  
**Status:** ACCEPTABLE - working as designed  

---

## ✅ SAFE SCRIPTS

### 4. ✅ **local-browser-preview.sh**
**Risk:** NONE  
**Status:** Safe - only opens files in browser  

### 5. ✅ **dns_check_stupidiots.sh**
**Risk:** NONE  
**Status:** Safe - only checks DNS, no modifications  

---

## 🚨 ROOT CAUSES

### Why These Are Dangerous:

1. **No Path Validation**
   - Scripts don't verify `$REMOTE_DIR` is correct before deletion
   - Could delete wrong directory if variable is misconfigured

2. **No Dry-Run Mode**
   - Can't test what will be deleted before doing it
   - No preview of changes

3. **No Backup Verification**
   - Backups created but not tested
   - Could deploy with broken backup

4. **Limited Confirmation**
   - Only rollback script asks for confirmation
   - Staging script runs without asking

5. **Using `rm -rf`**
   - Most destructive command in Linux
   - Should use safer methods like `rsync --delete`

---

## 🛡️ RECOMMENDED FIXES

### Priority 1: IMMEDIATE (Before Any Deployment)

1. **Add Path Validation**
   ```bash
   # Validate REMOTE_DIR before any rm -rf
   if [[ ! "$REMOTE_DIR" =~ ^/var/www/stupidiots.com ]]; then
       echo "ERROR: Invalid REMOTE_DIR: $REMOTE_DIR"
       exit 1
   fi
   ```

2. **Add Confirmation for Staging**
   ```bash
   echo "About to deploy to: $REMOTE_DIR"
   read -p "Type 'YES' to continue: " CONFIRM
   if [ "$CONFIRM" != "YES" ]; then
       exit 0
   fi
   ```

3. **Replace `rm -rf` with `rsync --delete`**
   ```bash
   # Instead of: sudo rm -rf "$REMOTE_DIR"/*
   # Use: rsync -av --delete SOURCE/ DEST/
   ```

### Priority 2: ENHANCED SAFETY

4. **Add Dry-Run Mode**
   ```bash
   DRY_RUN="${DRY_RUN:-false}"
   if [ "$DRY_RUN" = "true" ]; then
       echo "[DRY-RUN] Would delete: $REMOTE_DIR/*"
       exit 0
   fi
   ```

5. **Verify Backup Before Deploy**
   ```bash
   # Test backup can be extracted
   tar -tzf "$BACKUP_FILE" > /dev/null
   if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
       echo "ERROR: Backup verification failed"
       exit 1
   fi
   ```

6. **Add Automated Testing**
   ```bash
   # After deploy, verify site responds
   HTTP_CODE=$(curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" "$SITE_URL")
   if [ "$HTTP_CODE" != "200" ]; then
       echo "ERROR: Site not responding correctly"
       # Auto-rollback?
   fi
   ```

## 📋 INCIDENT CORRELATION

**From Incident Report (Oct 16):**
> Script contains dangerous command on line 55:
> `sudo rm -rf "${REMOTE_DIR:?}/"*`

**Finding:**
- Current scripts use `$REMOTE_DIR/*` (line 84 in staging, 109 in rollback)
- Similar pattern to incident report
- Confirms these scripts were likely involved in Oct 16 near-deletion

**Note:** The `:?` syntax would have prevented deletion if `$REMOTE_DIR` was empty, but current scripts don't have this protection.

---

## ✅ SAFE DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST

Before running ANY deployment script:

- [ ] SSH keys configured and tested
- [ ] `REMOTE_DIR` variable verified correct
- [ ] Backup system tested (can restore from backup)
- [ ] Staging tested (never deploy directly to production)
- [ ] Confirmation prompts added
- [ ] Dry-run mode tested
- [ ] Rollback procedure documented and tested
- [ ] Production verified after deployment

---

## 🚀 NEXT STEPS

### Immediate Actions:
1. ✅ **DO NOT** run these scripts in current state
2. **Create** safer versions with validations
3. **Test** in staging first
4. **Document** exact procedures
5. **Setup** SSH access properly

### This Session:
1. Create safe versions of scripts
2. Add validation and confirmations
3. Setup SSH access
4. Test dry-run mode
5. Update documentation

---

**Audit Status:** COMPLETE  
**Recommendation:** Scripts need modification before use  
**Risk Level:** HIGH - Could cause production outage  
**Action Required:** Fix before any deployment
