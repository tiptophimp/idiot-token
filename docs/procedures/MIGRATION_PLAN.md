# üì¶ MIGRATION PLAN - Moving to Unified Directory

**Created:** 2025-10-16  
**Status:** In Progress  

---

## üéØ OBJECTIVE
Move all scattered files from multiple locations into one unified directory structure at `C:\idiot-project\`

---

## üìç SOURCE LOCATIONS (Known)

### Primary Source
- `C:\idiot-backup\idiot-token\` - Current working directory
  - Contains: public_html, reports, docs, scripts, data, etc.

### Other Potential Locations (To Be Identified)
- Various scattered folders across the system
- Empty directories
- Duplicate files

---

## üóÇÔ∏è MIGRATION STRATEGY

### Phase 1: Copy Critical Files (SAFE - No Deletions)
1. **Website files** ‚Üí `C:\idiot-project\website\dev\`
   - Source: `C:\idiot-backup\idiot-token\public_html\`
   
2. **Token data** ‚Üí `C:\idiot-project\token\`
   - Source: `C:\idiot-backup\idiot-token\data\`
   - Source: `C:\idiot-backup\idiot-token\scripts\idiot_*.py`
   
3. **Documentation** ‚Üí `C:\idiot-project\docs\`
   - Source: `C:\idiot-backup\idiot-token\docs\`
   - Source: `C:\idiot-backup\idiot-token\reports\`
   
4. **Deployment config** ‚Üí `C:\idiot-project\deploy\`
   - Source: `C:\idiot-backup\idiot-token\deploy\`
   - Source: `C:\idiot-backup\idiot-token\scripts\deploy_*.sh`

### Phase 2: Verification
- [ ] All critical files copied
- [ ] File counts match
- [ ] No data loss
- [ ] Structure makes sense

### Phase 3: Cleanup (User Approval Required)
- [ ] Identify duplicate files
- [ ] Identify empty directories
- [ ] Create cleanup plan
- [ ] Get user approval
- [ ] Execute cleanup
- [ ] Final verification

- [ ] Check file structure intact

### Token Files  
- [ ] Copy `data/` folder
- [ ] Copy Python scripts
- [ ] Copy contract information

## üö® SAFETY MEASURES

1. **NEVER delete source files** until verified in new location
2. **Compare file counts** before and after
3. **Test critical files** after migration
4. **Keep backups** of everything
5. **User approval** before any deletions

## üìä PROGRESS TRACKING

### Completed
- [x] New directory structure created
- [x] Documentation framework established
- [x] Deployment scripts created

### In Progress
- [ ] Copying website files
- [ ] Copying token files
- [ ] Copying documentation

### Pending
- [ ] Git initialization

## üîç VERIFICATION COMMANDS

```bash
# Count files in old location
find C:/idiot-backup/idiot-token/public_html -type f | wc -l

# Count files in new location  
find C:/idiot-project/website/dev -type f | wc -l

# Compare directory structures
diff -qr C:/idiot-backup/idiot-token/public_html C:/idiot-project/website/dev

# Check for broken links or missing files
# (Manual testing in browser)
```

**Status will be updated as migration progresses.**
