## Project update summary (2025-10-15)

### Goal
Connect ChatGPT and Cursor to local files; avoid path issues on Windows.

### Actions performed
- Cloned `samrawal/chatgpt-localfiles` and created Python venv in `C:\IDIOT_TOKEN_WEBSITE\chatgpt-localfiles`.
- Installed Windows-friendly deps (Flask, Flask-CORS, PyPDF2, python-docx); skipped macOS GUI deps.
- Attempted to run local server; path quoting failed in Git Bash using `C:\...` syntax; confirmed correct cmd/bash variants.
- Mirror-copied the original workspace into `C:\IDIOT_TOKEN_WEBSITE` to avoid exclamation-mark path issues.
- Deduplicated by content and moved 458 duplicates to `.trash_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS`, keeping one copy per file.

### Issues encountered
- Git Bash path semantics for Windows drives caused `cd C:\...` failures.
- In-use rename of the original folder was blocked by the editor.
- PowerShell quoting inside Git Bash/cmd wrappers led to conditional check errors.
- macOS-only dependencies (`rumps`, `pyobjc`) not compatible on Windows; not required for server.

### Current state
- Your canonical working folder: `C:\IDIOT_TOKEN_WEBSITE` (manually populated by you).
- Duplicates: already removed; backups reside under `.trash_*` at the project root.
- No local plugin servers are intentionally left running.

### Next suggestions (optional)
- If you want ChatGPT access without localhost plugins: create a private GitHub repo and share read-only access; exclude secrets/archives.
- Cursor already reads the full folder if opened as a workspace.

### Reference
- Local files plugin used: `samrawal/chatgpt-localfiles` (`https://github.com/samrawal/chatgpt-localfiles.git`).
