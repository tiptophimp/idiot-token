## [v2.0-realistic] - 2025-10-10

### 🎯 Major Update: Realistic Tokenomics

**Status:** CURRENT

After initial planning phase, we've updated all documentation to reflect the actual implementation rather than theoretical plans. This update prioritizes honesty and transparency over complex vesting schemes that don't yet exist.

### Added
- ✅ `IDIOT_Tokenomics_REALISTIC.md` - Honest, simplified tokenomics documentation
- ✅ `IDIOT_Website_Content_Update.md` - Guide for updating website content
- ✅ Transparent multisig governance structure (3-of-4 Treasury, 2-of-4 Ops)
- ✅ Flexible community distribution model (250M allocation)
- ✅ Growing liquidity strategy (10M → 150M over time)

### Changed
- 🔄 Token allocation simplified to 65/25/10 (Treasury/Community/Liquidity)
- 🔄 Removed claims of vesting contracts that don't exist yet
- 🔄 Removed claims of locked LP that isn't actually locked
- 🔄 Shifted from "cryptographically immutable" to "transparently flexible"
- 🔄 Updated messaging to be community-first and honest

### Removed
- ❌ Complex vesting schedule claims (Reserve, Team, Treasury timelocks)
- ❌ Automated weekly distribution claims (not yet implemented)
- ❌ 24-month LP lock claims (LP is managed, not locked)
- ❌ Team allocation promises (no separate team bucket)

### Why This Update?
**Key reasons for the change:**
1. **No External Holders Yet** - Perfect time to be transparent about actual structure
2. **Simplicity Over Complexity** - Meme tokens don't need institutional-grade tokenomics
3. **Flexibility** - Can adapt to community needs vs. rigid schedules
4. **Honesty** - Better to be clear about what we have than pretend
5. **SEC Compliance** - Avoid claiming guarantees we can't enforce

### Impact
- Zero impact on existing holders (only ~2,500 tokens circulating to friend)
- All multisig addresses remain the same and verifiable
- Community allocation (250M) still dedicated to airdrops/rewards
- Liquidity strategy remains focused on growth

## [v1.0-initial] - 2025-10-06

### 🚀 Initial Planning Phase

**Status:** ARCHIVED (superseded by v2.0)

Original tokenomics documentation with complex vesting schedules, timelock contracts, and automated distribution systems. This represented the initial theoretical plan before implementation.

### Original Allocations (v1.0)
- Reserve: 449,357,000 (44.94%) - 6m cliff + 30m vest
- Community: 250,000,000 (25.00%) - 104 weekly emissions
- DEX Liquidity: 150,000,000 (15.00%) - 24m lock
- Team: 100,000,000 (10.00%) - 12m cliff + 36m vest
- Treasury: 50,643,000 (5.06%) - 6m cliff + 24m vest

### Why Archived?
This plan was created before token deployment and represented an idealized structure. After deployment and initial operations, we realized:
- Complex vesting adds overhead without current benefit (no external team/investors)
- Flexibility better serves early-stage meme token
- Honest, simple structure builds more trust than complex promises
- Can always add structure later if community demands it

### Lessons Learned
- Start simple, add complexity only when needed
- Transparency > elaborate plans
- Community feedback > rigid schedules
- Meme tokens can be professionally managed without being corporate
