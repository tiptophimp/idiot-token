## **🎮 Cursor Control Console**

### **Available Tasks (Ctrl + Shift + P → Tasks: Run Task):**

| Task | Purpose | Network | Status |
|------|---------|---------|--------|
| **Compile Contracts** | Compile Solidity contracts | Local | ✅ Ready |
| **Deploy Vesting Contract** | Deploy all vesting contracts | Base | ⚠️ Needs SAFE addresses |
| **Transfer Ownership** | Move control to governance | Base | ⚠️ Needs SAFE addresses |
| **Assign Governance Roles** | Grant DAO proposer/executor rights | Base | ⚠️ Needs SAFE addresses |
| **Revoke Deployer Roles** | Remove deployer privileges | Base | ⚠️ Needs SAFE addresses |
| **Verify + Audit + Notify** | Complete verification & transparency | Base | ✅ Ready |
| **System Health Check** | Environment diagnostics | Local | ✅ Ready |

---

## **🚀 Execution Sequence**

### **Phase 1: Pre-Deployment Setup**

#### **1.1 Configure SAFE Addresses**
```bash
# Edit scripts/deployVesting.js
# Replace placeholder addresses:
# 0xTR_SAFE → Your actual TR-SAFE multisig address
# 0xOPS_SAFE → Your actual OPS-SAFE multisig address
```

#### **1.2 Configure Environment Variables**
```bash
# Edit .env file with your actual values:
PRIVATE_KEY=0xYOUR_ACTUAL_PRIVATE_KEY
BASESCAN_API_KEY=YOUR_ACTUAL_BASESCAN_API_KEY
DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL=https://discordapp.com/api/webhooks/...
SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL=https://hooks.slack.com/services/...
IPFS_PROJECT_ID=YOUR_INFURA_IPFS_PROJECT_ID
IPFS_PROJECT_SECRET=YOUR_INFURA_IPFS_PROJECT_SECRET
```

#### **1.3 System Health Check**
```bash
# Run in Cursor: Ctrl + Shift + P → Tasks: Run Task → System Health Check
# Verify all environment variables and network connectivity
```

---

### **Phase 2: Contract Deployment**

#### **2.1 Deploy Vesting Contracts**
```bash
# Run in Cursor: Ctrl + Shift + P → Tasks: Run Task → Deploy Vesting Contract
# This will:
# - Deploy 4 vesting contracts (Reserve, Treasury, Team, Community)
# - Update deployment/addresses.json with contract addresses
# - Show transaction hashes and BaseScan links
```

**Expected Output:**
```
🏗️ IDIOT Token Vesting Contract Deployment
==========================================

🚀 Deploying Reserve Vesting Contract
==========================================
📝 Deployer: 0xYourAddress
✅ Reserve deployed to: 0xContractAddress
🔗 BaseScan: https://basescan.org/address/0xContractAddress
👤 Owner: 0xTR_SAFE
📅 Start: 2026-04-01T00:00:00.000Z
⏱️ Duration: 36 months

[... similar output for Treasury, Team, Community ...]

🎉 All vesting contracts deployed successfully!
🔄 Next step: Transfer ownership to governance contracts
```

---

### **Phase 3: Governance Handover**

#### **3.1 Transfer Ownership**
```bash
# Run in Cursor: Ctrl + Shift + P → Tasks: Run Task → Transfer Ownership
# This will:
# - Transfer ownership of all contracts to SAFE multisigs
# - Verify ownership transfers
# - Update deployment/addresses.json
```

#### **3.2 Assign Governance Roles**
```bash
# Run in Cursor: Ctrl + Shift + P → Tasks: Run Task → Assign Governance Roles
# This will:
# - Grant PROPOSER and EXECUTOR roles to SAFE multisigs
# - Enable DAO governance functionality
# - Update deployment/addresses.json
```

#### **3.3 Revoke Deployer Roles**
```bash
# Run in Cursor: Ctrl + Shift + P → Tasks: Run Task → Revoke Deployer Roles
# This will:
# - Remove all deployer privileges
# - Complete security lockdown
# - Verify role revocations
```

---

### **Phase 4: Verification & Transparency**

#### **4.1 Complete Verification**
```bash
# Run in Cursor: Ctrl + Shift + P → Tasks: Run Task → Verify + Audit + Notify
# This will:
# - Verify all contracts on BaseScan
# - Generate comprehensive audit logs
# - Upload to IPFS for immutability
# - Send notifications to Discord/Slack
# - Create GitHub release with audit data
```

---

## **🔍 Post-Execution Verification**

### **4.2 Verify Success**

#### **BaseScan Verification:**
- ✅ All contracts show as "Verified"
- ✅ Owner = Timelock or Safe multisig
- ✅ Source code matches deployed contracts

#### **GitHub Verification:**
- ✅ New release tag: `audit-vYYYY.MM.DD-HHMM`
- ✅ Audit logs attached to release
- ✅ Transparency page generated

#### **Discord/Slack Verification:**
- ✅ Messages from "IDIOT Audit Bot"
- ✅ Verification confirmation
- ✅ BaseScan links provided

#### **IPFS Verification:**
- ✅ CID resolves to latest audit log
- ✅ Immutable proof of verification
- ✅ Historical audit trail preserved

## **🔐 Security Status After Execution**

### **✅ Achieved:**
- 🔒 **Full Decentralization**: No single point of control
- 🔒 **Governance Handover**: SAFE multisigs control all contracts
- 🔒 **Role-Based Access**: PROPOSER/EXECUTOR roles properly assigned
- 🔒 **Deployer Lockdown**: All deployer privileges revoked
- 🔒 **Immutable Verification**: All contracts verified on BaseScan
- 🔒 **Transparency**: Complete audit trail and public verification

### **🎯 Final State:**
- **Owner**: SAFE multisigs (not deployer)
- **Governance**: DAO-controlled via SAFE multisigs
- **Security**: Deployer has zero privileges
- **Transparency**: Public verification and audit logs
- **Immutability**: IPFS-stored audit trail

---

## **🔄 Ongoing Operations**

### **Monthly Tasks:**
- **Dependency Updates**: Run "Update Dependencies" task
- **Health Checks**: Run "System Health Check" task

### **Quarterly Tasks:**
- **Key Rotation**: Update `.env` and GitHub Secrets
- **Audit Backup**: Copy `/audit/` directory

### **As Needed:**
- **IPFS Revalidation**: Run "Revalidate Audit on IPFS" task
- **Manual Verification**: Run "Verify + Audit + Notify" task

---

## **🚨 Critical Success Factors**

### **Before Starting:**
1. ✅ **SAFE Addresses**: Must be real multisig addresses
2. ✅ **Environment Variables**: All must be configured
3. ✅ **Network Connectivity**: Base network accessible
4. ✅ **Sufficient Gas**: ETH for transaction fees

### **During Execution:**
1. ✅ **Sequential Order**: Execute tasks in exact order
2. ✅ **No Interruptions**: Complete each phase fully
3. ✅ **Verify Each Step**: Check outputs before proceeding
4. ✅ **Monitor Transactions**: Watch for failures

### **After Completion:**
1. ✅ **Verify All Contracts**: Check BaseScan verification
2. ✅ **Test Governance**: Ensure SAFE multisigs can control
3. ✅ **Confirm Security**: Deployer should have no privileges
4. ✅ **Validate Transparency**: Check audit logs and IPFS

---

## **🆘 Emergency Procedures**

### **If Deployment Fails:**
1. Check gas fees and network connectivity
2. Verify SAFE addresses are correct
3. Ensure sufficient ETH balance
4. Re-run failed task after fixing issues

### **If Ownership Transfer Fails:**
1. Verify SAFE addresses are correct
2. Check contract permissions
3. Ensure deployer still has ownership
4. Re-run transfer after fixing issues

### **If Verification Fails:**
1. Check BaseScan API key
2. Verify contract addresses
3. Ensure contracts are deployed
4. Re-run verification after fixing issues

---

## **🎉 Success Criteria**

### **You have successfully completed governance handover when:**
- ✅ All 4 vesting contracts deployed and verified
- ✅ Ownership transferred to SAFE multisigs
- ✅ Governance roles assigned to SAFE multisigs
- ✅ Deployer roles completely revoked
- ✅ All contracts verified on BaseScan
- ✅ Audit logs generated and uploaded to IPFS
- ✅ GitHub release created with audit data
- ✅ Discord/Slack notifications sent
- ✅ System is fully decentralized and secure
