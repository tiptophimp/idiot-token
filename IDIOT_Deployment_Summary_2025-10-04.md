## 🔐 Security Notes
- All private keys remain offline — **Ledger-only signing** enforced.
- No direct .env secrets exposed during any stage.
- Smart contract source hashes match BaseScan verified build.
- All metadata (allocations, vesting schedules, etc.) stored for immutable audit.

## 🏁 Status: DEPLOYMENT COMPLETE — FINAL VERIFICATION PENDING
All critical components are live and functional. Ledger-assisted verification will finalize all BaseScan authenticity records.
