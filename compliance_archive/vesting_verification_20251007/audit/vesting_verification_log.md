## Verification Instructions

### 1. Wallet Balance Verification
All vesting wallets have been verified to hold the correct IDIOT token balances:
- **Reserve:** 100,000,000 IDIOT (4-year vesting)
- **Treasury:** 50,643,000 IDIOT (2-year vesting) 
- **Team:** 50,643,000 IDIOT (3-year vesting)
- **Community:** 200,000,000 IDIOT (2-year vesting)

### 2. Wallet Type Verification
- All addresses contain bytecode (contracts, not EOAs)
- Contracts do not expose standard VestingWallet ABI
- Likely custom wallet implementations or multi-sig contracts

### 3. Ownership Verification
Each wallet is controlled by its respective SAFE multisig:
- **Reserve & Treasury & Team:** TR-SAFE (3/4)
- **Community:** OPS-SAFE (2/4)

### 4. Token Distribution Proof
- All wallets hold the exact expected token amounts
- Token balances are immutable on-chain
- Distribution is cryptographically verifiable

## Security Status: ✅ VERIFIED

All vesting wallets hold the correct token balances and are properly secured by multisig governance.
