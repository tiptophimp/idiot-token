## 🎯 REALISTIC TOKENOMICS (V2.0) - IMPLEMENTED

**What I Used:**
Your **realistic, honest** tokenomics from our earlier work:

**Distribution:**
- **65% (650M) - Project Treasury**
  - Multisig controlled (3-of-4)
  - For liquidity, development, operations
  - Transparent on-chain tracking

- **25% (250M) - Community Fund**
  - Multisig controlled (2-of-4)
  - Airdrops, rewards, incentives
  - 104-week distribution target

- **10% (100M) - Active Liquidity**
  - Uniswap V3 IDIOT/WETH 0.3%
  - Growing to 150M over 12 months
  - Flexible management

**What I DIDN'T claim:**
- ❌ No fake vesting contracts
- ❌ No locked liquidity claims
- ❌ No hidden team allocations
- ❌ No complex promises

**Honest messaging throughout!**
