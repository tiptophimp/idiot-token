# DNS Check Report — stupidiots.com (2025-10-14)

## Summary
- Website not loading due to DNS A records pointing to a non-responsive IP.
- Web server on the intended droplet responds 200 OK for both HTTP/HTTPS when addressed directly.

## Current DNS
- Nameservers (NS): ns1.digitalocean.com, ns2.digitalocean.com, ns3.digitalocean.com
- SOA: ns1.digitalocean.com (serial: 1760336930)
- A (apex): 75.88.143.226  — TIMES OUT on :80/:443
- A (www): 75.88.143.226  — TIMES OUT on :80/:443
- AAAA (apex): none
- TXT: "v=spf1 include:_spf.hostinger.com ~all" (mail-related only)

## Origin/Web Server
- Target droplet IP (from docs): 31.97.13.9
- HTTP check: `curl -I http://31.97.13.9` → 200 OK
- HTTPS check: `curl -I -k https://31.97.13.9` → 200 OK (certificate/SNI not validated in this test)

## Root Cause
- DNS A records for `stupidiots.com` and `www.stupidiots.com` are set to 75.88.143.226 instead of the droplet IP 31.97.13.9. As a result, requests hit an IP that does not serve the site and time out.

## Required Fix
Update DNS at DigitalOcean (since NS are DO) to point web traffic to the droplet:
1. Set A record for `@` (apex) → 31.97.13.9
2. Set A record for `www` → 31.97.13.9 (or make `www` a CNAME to `@`)
3. TTL: 300s (or your preferred low value) during migration; raise after stable

Optional (post-cutover):
- Ensure valid SSL for `stupidiots.com` and `www.stupidiots.com` on the droplet (Let’s Encrypt or existing cert). The server answered 200 OK over HTTPS, but cert/SNI validation wasn’t verified in this quick probe.

## Verification Steps (after change propagates)
- DNS:
  - `nslookup stupidiots.com`
  - `nslookup www.stupidiots.com`
  - Expect: 31.97.13.9
- HTTP/HTTPS:
  - `curl -I http://stupidiots.com`
  - `curl -I https://stupidiots.com`
  - `curl -I http://www.stupidiots.com`
  - `curl -I https://www.stupidiots.com`
  - Expect: 200 OK (or 301 → 200 depending on redirects)

## Notes
- Existing SPF TXT is fine for email routing and unrelated to web downtime.
- Current `.htaccess` already forces HTTPS and canonicalizes non-www → apex.
