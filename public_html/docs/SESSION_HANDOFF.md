### High Priority
- [ ] Audit all deployment scripts - Why: **SAFETY CRITICAL**
- [ ] Fix dangerous rm -rf commands - Why: Could delete production
- [ ] Verify production files match local dev - Why: Need source of truth
- [ ] Audit 8 scattered folders - Why: Causing confusion
- [ ] Test SSH server access - Why: Can't deploy without it

### Medium Priority
- [ ] Determine GitHub repo status
- [ ] Connect GitHub remote if repo exists
- [ ] Create backup-before-deploy system
- [ ] Test staging deployment workflow

### Low Priority / Future
- [ ] Archive old folders to C:\OLD_ARCHIVE
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Create monitoring/alerts for production

### Completed This Session
- ‚úÖ Created initial git commit (35ac91a) - 49 files committed - Completed: 2025-10-16 13:40
- ‚úÖ Created session handoff template and documentation

## üß† DECISIONS & CONTEXT

### Recent Decisions Made
1. **Decision:** Use C:\idiot-project as the primary/only working directory
   - **Date:** Oct 16, 2025
   - **Reason:** After near-deletion incident, needed clean organized structure
   - **By:** AI (previous session)
   - **Impact:** Created new folder, copied files there

### Important Context
- **Why was the Oct 16 structure created?** In response to near-deletion incident - needed safer workflow with backups and staging
- **Why are there 8 folders?** ‚ùì **UNKNOWN** - This is part of the chaos we need to clean up
- **What's the relationship between folders?** ‚ùì **UNKNOWN** - Need to audit
- **What's the deployment history?** ‚ùì **UNKNOWN** - Need to ask user or check server logs

### Conventions & Standards
- **File Naming:** Per user rules - specific file names must not be changed (index.html, hero banner image, etc.)
- **Commit Messages:** Standard format used in initial commit
- **Branch Strategy:** Using master branch currently
- **Code Style:** Not defined

## üéì LESSONS LEARNED

### What Works Well
- Git version control for safety
- Session handoff documentation
- Asking user to verify before proceeding

### What Doesn't Work
- Having 8 different folders - causes massive confusion
- Not having filled-in incident reports
- Not auditing scripts before running them
- Templates without actual data

### Improvements Made
- Created comprehensive session handoff system
- Made initial git commit for safety

### Still Needs Improvement
- Need to audit and fix deployment scripts
- Need to consolidate scattered folders
- Need filled-in documentation (not just templates)
- Need verification of production vs. local files

---

## üîÆ NEXT SESSION PREP

### What the Next Person Needs to Know
1. **Git commit was successful** - All files are safely in version control locally
2. **Deployment scripts are UNSAFE** - Do not run until audited
3. **8 folders exist** - Need to audit and consolidate
4. **Production status unknown** - Haven't verified live site matches local files
5. **GitHub status unknown** - Need user input on whether repo exists

### Recommended Next Steps
1. **Audit deployment scripts** - Why: Safety critical - Priority: **HIGH**
2. **Test SSH connection** - Why: Can't deploy without it - Priority: **HIGH**
3. **Verify production files** - Why: Need to know source of truth - Priority: **HIGH**
4. **Get GitHub info from user** - Why: Need remote backup - Priority: **MEDIUM**
5. **Audit scattered folders** - Why: Causing confusion - Priority: **MEDIUM**

### What to Review First
- [ ] File: `deploy/scripts/*.sh` - Why: May contain dangerous commands
- [ ] Documentation: `docs/reports/INCIDENT_REPORT_2025-10-16_NEAR_DELETION.md` - Why: Need to understand what happened
- [ ] Folder: Each of the 8 C:\ folders - Why: Need to consolidate

### Questions That Need Answering
- [ ] Does a GitHub repo exist for this project? If yes, what's the URL?
- [ ] What exactly happened in the Oct 16 incident? Was production deleted?
- [ ] Which of the 8 folders was the original source for production?
- [ ] Are the files in website/dev/ the current production version?
- [ ] Where are the SSH keys? Are they configured?
- [ ] When was the last successful deployment to production?

---

## üìù SESSION NOTES

### What Happened This Session
- User asked if AI knows what we're working on
- Reviewed project status and structure
- User found folder structure and questioned why subfolders were empty

- Found 8 different folders with similar names on C:\ drive
- User clarified they were looking at the same C:\idiot-project folder
- Discussed git commits and GitHub setup
- User pointed out critical info was missing from reports
- Created comprehensive session handoff template and current state document
- Made initial git commit: 49 files, 7,363 lines of code committed successfully

### Problems Encountered
- PowerShell command syntax errors when trying to search for folders
- Confusion about which folder user was looking at
- Missing critical information in existing documentation (templates not filled in)
- Unknown status of GitHub repository
- Unknown details about Oct 16 incident
