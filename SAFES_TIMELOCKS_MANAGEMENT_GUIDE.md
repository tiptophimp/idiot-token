- OPS-SAFE still works (need 2 of 4, have 3 remaining)
- **Action:** Add new signer to replace lost one
- **Requires:** Current signers' approval

### If 2 Signers Lost:
- TR-SAFE fails (need 3, only have 2)
- OPS-SAFE still works (need 2, have 2)
- **Critical:** Funds in TR-SAFE timelocks become inaccessible
- **Prevention:** Keep backup seeds secure, consider adding 5th signer
