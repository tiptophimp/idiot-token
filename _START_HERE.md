# ‚ö†Ô∏è START HERE - READ THIS FIRST ‚ö†Ô∏è

## üö® MANDATORY FIRST STEP FOR EVERY SESSION

**Before doing ANYTHING else:**

### 1. **AI Assistant: Read the handoff file**
```
Read file: SESSION_HANDOFF.md
```
This contains ALL the context you need to continue work.

### 2. **Human: Always start with this prompt**
```
Read SESSION_HANDOFF.md and tell me what we're working on
```

### 3. **Note the start time** (for 60-minute updates)
- Write down current time
- Set reminder for 60 minutes from now

## ‚è∞ MANDATORY: UPDATE EVERY 60 MINUTES

**Every 60 minutes during active work:**

### 1. **Check production status**
```bash
bash scripts/check-production.sh
```
Or manually: Visit https://stupidiots.com and verify it's working

### 2. **Quick update to SESSION_HANDOFF.md**
- Add hourly update note with timestamp
- Update production status
- Note progress made this hour
- What you're working on next

### 3. **Quick commit**
```bash
git add SESSION_HANDOFF.md
git commit -m "Hourly update: [brief status]"
```

**Why every 60 minutes?**
- ‚úÖ Tracks production health continuously
- ‚úÖ Prevents losing progress if session crashes
- ‚úÖ Creates detailed audit trail
- ‚úÖ Forces regular verification of live site

**Use this prompt every hour:**
```
See .cursor/prompts/hourly-update.md for instructions
```
