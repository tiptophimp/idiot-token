# Stupid Supercut Kit (Public-Use Clips)

This kit assembles a ~35s montage of harmless, staged "people doing stupid things" moments,
using **public-use** stock footage (Pexels/Pixabay). All scripts are **local-only**—you download
the clips, drop them into `clips/` with the given names, then run a single command.

## How to Use
1) Download each clip from the URLs in **SOURCES.md** and save into `clips/` using these exact filenames:
   - clip01.mp4 ... clip07.mp4
2) (Optional) Put a CC0/royalty-free music file as `bgm.mp3` in the project root.
3) On macOS/Linux: `bash compose.sh`  — On Windows: double-click `compose.bat`.
4) Your final video will be **stupid-supercut-1080p.mp4** in this folder.

## Safety & Licensing
